How do I approach designing software?
I design software by planning how each part works together before coding. 
This project helped me improve my skills in organizing and visualizing components. 
I followed a process of testing ideas, adjusting as needed, and refining my design. 
These strategies will help me with future projects.

How do I approach developing programs?
While building the 3D scene, I learned to debug object movement, lighting, and interactions. 
Iteration was important. I tested, fixed, and improved repeatedly. 
My approach to coding became more organized over the milestones, which helped me finish the project.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science helps me solve problems and create applications. Working with 3D graphics taught me to 
visualize ideas and manage complex scenes. These skills will be useful in both my education and future career.


The full 3D scene project is included in this repository as 7-1_Final_Project.zip.
